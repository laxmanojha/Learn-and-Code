        Is 'employee' an object or a data structure? Why?

        Explaination: As per discussion in L&C I understood that here 'employee' is a data structure.
        Why I am saying so because it does not have additional functionality but only getters and setters which indirectly exposes attributes or data to outer environment like data structures.
